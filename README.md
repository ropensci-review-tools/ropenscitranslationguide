### Technical details

Deployment is done via GitHub Actions: 

* whenever there's a GitHub release, the book is built and its content is then pushed to the `gh-pages` branch.

* whenever there's a push to `main`, the book is built and its content is then pushed to the `dev-site` branch that gets [deployed to Netlify]().

Refer to [this blog post for more details and resources about bookdown deployment on GitHub Actions](https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/04/07/bookdown-learnings/#5-how-to-deploy-a-preview-of-the-book-for-pull-requests).
