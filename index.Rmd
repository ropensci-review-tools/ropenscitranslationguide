# Preface {.unnumbered}

## Welcome! 

This book is a guide for people who would like to localize rOpenSci materials. It is a reference for all the step in the process of localization, which include translations. 

We have a process that borrows ideas from our software peer review system and from the manteining of open source projects.

At rOpenSci we use peer-review to ensure the quiality of our code and our content and we implement a system of review and manteinance for the different languages version of our materials.



The guide contains:

- The motivation for multilingual publishing.
- The general guide with the internationalization infrastructure, step-by-step technical process, and localization considerations.
- The language-specific guides, which include the explanation of the infrastructure and technical process and the detailed development of localization considerations.
- The Glossary language-specific, which includes the technical terms to be translated and the technical terms that we will not translate.
