# Preface {.unnumbered}

## Welcome!

This book explanins of all the steps and tools involved in the localization of our materials, including translations.

We design and build a process that takes ideas from our software peer review system and the maintenance of open-source projects.  At rOpenSci, we use peer review to ensure the quality of our code and our content. We also implement a system to review and maintain the different languages version of our materials.

## Intended Audience

This book is a guide for people who would like to localize rOpenSci materials or contribute to maintaining localized material.  You don't need to be a proffesional translator or developer.  The following personas are examples of the types of people that are our target audience.

Ana
:  
  is a Colombian student doing her Ph.D. at FAMAF in Argentina. She works with geospatial data. She is not an expert in programming, but she took one of The Carpentries workshops for scientists and used some of the rOpenSci suite packages for handling and accessing geospatial data for her thesis.
  Language was one of the barriers she faced when learning to code. Ana wants to contribute by translating material into her native language so others can access this knowledge with less effort. This book will show her how to do a new translation and how to review an existing one.
 
Francesco
:  
  will send their packages to the rOpenSci review process in Spanish. They know that this will ensure the quality of their software and will also facilitate its publication in JOSS, which will give them academic credit for their job at Universidad Mayor de San Andr√©s in Bolivia. They read the Spanish version of the book for development and a peer-review package to prepare the submission. If their review experience is good, they will volunteer to be a reviewer in their native language and contribute to the book. This guide will explain how to become a contributor and maintainer of translated material and the infrastructure that allows translations.

Bauti
:
  is the co-founder of a user group in his city in Chile.  With a couple of university classmates, he teaches and learns together how to code and do reproducible analysis using different languages.  He uses rOpenSci Spanish material during his workshops and would like to have the material from other programming languages in Spanish. He wonders how rOpenSci manages translation. This book will show him how we organize translation and what tools we use so that he can apply in his community.   

## What You Will Learn

The guide contains:

- The motivation for multilingual publishing.
- The general guide with the internationalization infrastructure, step-by-step technical process, and localization considerations.
- The language-specific guides, which include the explanation of the infrastructure and technical process and the detailed development of localization considerations.
- The Glossary: language-specific, which includes the technical terms to translate and the technical terms we will not translate.

At rOpenSci, we use GitHub to host our code, including our packages and books. The step-by-step technical process refers to working with GitHub, like making pull requests, reviewing and commenting on pull requests, and creating issues. It also explains how to use the {babeldown} R package that facilitates working with translations.
