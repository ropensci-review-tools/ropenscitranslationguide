# Motivation

## Language barrier

> The predominant language of open source is English—in
code, content, and community interactions—and English
proficiency is a metric by which performance and
personality can be judged. [^1] 

The Linux Foundation report also identify _language 
access_ as one of the _environmental Barriers to Equity 
in Open Source_.

Publishing multilingual resources can lower these
barriers by _increasing access to knowledge_, which helps
_democratize access to quality resources_, and therefore
_increases the potential for contributing_ to software 
and open science projects.

For this reason, we are embarking on an effort to 
translate rOpenSci’s material on best
practices for software development, code review, and 
contribution to open source projects beyond the English
language starting with _Spanish_.

Spanish is the second most-spoken native language in the 
world. It is also one of the most geographically
widespread languages, reaching many countries with 
Spanish as an official language. 

The Spanish-speaking R Community has been growing and 
very active in the last years. Furthermore, it has 
carried out various activities related to translations of
materials such as books, cheatshets, guides and datasets. 

In 2017 several Latin American R-Ladies start with the 
translations to Spanish of the R-Ladies' [Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code
-of-Conduct#spanish) and their Rules and Guidelines. 

In 2018, the R Community in Latin America collectively 
translated the [R for Data Science (R4DS)
book](https://es.r4ds.hadley.nz/) to Spanish.  This 
includes the translation of all the data sets included in
the book compiled in the package 
[{datos}](https://github.com/cienciadedatos/datos) in 
Spanish and {dados} in
[Portuguese](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dados/index.html), becoming an excellent tool for teaching.

From the success of the collective and volunteer 
translation of R4DS, the community also translated 
[Teaching Tech Together](http://teachtogether.tech/es/index.html) and 
contributed to several translations to Spanish of [RStudio
CheatSheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/?type=translations/#translation-12), 
[The Carpentries](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)’ 
and [The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/es/) 
lessons. 

Driven by this active and growing Spanish-speaking community, rOpenSci 
[successfully piloted](https://ropensci.org/blog/2021/07/27/censo2017/) 
our first [Spanish-language peer review](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/2019-06-28/), 
where the submission itself, and all reviews, and editorial responses were in Spanish.

All this work and previous experience generated the right conditions to start our multilingual publishing with Spanish.

## Internazionalization

_Internazionalization (i18n)_ refers to the technology and design decision to ensure an artifact, like software, can be adapted to several regions without engineering changes to the source code.

These code-wise design decisions include language and other aspects like date formats, currency, measure units, and support for different sets of characters, among others.

_Internazionalization_ is the technical solution that will allow us to localize our content. 

There are many solutions for internationalizing products and software. As we have already mentioned, there are previous experiences with content translation work in communities related to science, education, and open source.

We find Automatic Translators, Translation Management Systems, and version control systems among these solutions.

For example, _The Carpentries_, _The Turing Way_, and _R Contributor_ use _Transifex_, _Crowdin_, and _Weblate_ respectively, which are _Translation Management Systems_ to manage their translations.  

R Translations for Data Science, Teaching Tech Together, Data and Dice packages, and R-Ladies materials have used GitHub with Google Translate and DeepL, a version control system with translators, but no integration between the tools.

The choice of solutions depends on each community and goal. Translations are a valuable form of 
contribution. The technology we select to work on will impact the paths we generate so people can contribute. We chose a semiautomatic process based on using an automatic translator with a review for experts with experience in technical translation using GitHub.

GitHub is the platform where most of our processes run, and it is a tool that developers need and use to develop software and collaborate.  We will support our community member who needs to learn how to use this platform to contribute to our community. They will gain a skill that is useful beyond rOpenSci. 


## Localization

_Localization (l10n)_ is when you take a piece of content in its original form and then convert it into 
something more suitable for another country, audience, or city. It is all about making your content 
accessible and appealing to locals.
