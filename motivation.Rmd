# Motivation

You are reading the first edition **in progress** of rOpenSci Localization and Translation Guide. 
This chapter should be readable, but is undergoing final additions and polishing.

At rOpenSci we work to transform science through open data, software and reproducibility.  We provides community support, standards, and infrastructure for scientists and research software engineers working in R to develop, maintain, and publish high-quality open-source scientific software. In addition, we develop and maintain high-quality documentation and resources to support these activities.

We also believe that science and the research software we create to support it, should serve everyone in our communities, which means it needs to be sustainable, open, and built by and for all groups. Currently, however, there is a dismaying lack of diversity in scientific and open source communities in general. That disappointing lack of diversity is potentially detrimental to the sustainability, utility and productivity of projects.

rOpenSci is carrying out a series of activities and projects to transform science to ensure that serves everyone in our communities which include our multilingual publishing project.

## Language barrier

English is the _lingua franca_ for science creating a significant barrier for non-English speaker waiting to join the field. It is also the predominant language of open source in code, content, and community interactions making _language access_ one of the _environmental barriers to equity in open source_.[^1] . 

The UNESCO’s recommendation on open science highlights the need to overcome language barriers in order to achieve the open science core values and guiding principles of Equity and fairness, Diversity and inclusiveness, Equality of opportunities, and Collaboration, participation and inclusion[^2]. 

A recent study[^3] quantified the consequences of language barriers on the career development of researchers. The authors found that Non-native English researchers need:

- up to __91% more time to read__ English papers,

- up to __51% more time to write__ papers and their papers will be __rejected 2.6 times more often__. If accepted, they'll have to __revise it 12.5 more times__

-  When they present in English need up to __94% more time__ to prepare their presentations. They will __often avoid__ English speaking conferences and oral presentations.

Furthermore, the Linux Foundation report states, "English proficiency is a metric by which performance and personality can be judged"[^2]. 

These studies also higligh that "the magnitude of the disadvantage seems far beyond the level that can be overcome with individuals’ efforts."[^3]

By developing the technical and social infrastructure to publishing multilingual resources and publish our own resources in several languages, we can lower these
barriers by _increasing access to knowledge_ and
_democratize access to quality resources_, thereby
_increasing the potential for individuals to contribute_ to software 
and open science projects.

## Community driven translation

The Spanish-speaking R community has been very active and growing in recent years, and has undertaken various translation activities for technical materials such as books, cheatsheets, guides, and datasets.

In 2017, several Latin American [R-Ladies](https://www.rladies.org/) began translating the R-Ladies' [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/rladies/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and their Rules and Guidelines into Spanish.

In 2018, the [R community in Latin America collectively translated](https://youtu.be/kuHjpdgkSxg) the [R for Data Science](https://es.r4ds.hadley.nz/) book into Spanish. This included the translation of all the data sets used in the book, which were compiled in the [datos](https://github.com/cienciadedatos/datos) package, making it an excellent tool for teaching.

The community continued with the translation of [Teaching Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/es/index.html) and contributed to the translations into Spanish of the [Posit Cheatsheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/?type=translations/#translation-12),
[The Carpentries](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)’ 
and [The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/es/) lessons.

Driven by this active and growing Spanish-speaking community, rOpenSci [successfully piloted](https://ropensci.org/blog/2021/07/27/censo2017/) our first [Spanish-language peer review](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/2019-06-28/), where the submission itself, as well as all reviews and editorial responses, were in Spanish.

All of this work and previous experience created the right conditions for us to start our multilingual publishing in Spanish!
Spanish is the second most-spoken native language in the world and is one of the most geographically widespread languages, being an official language in many countries[^3].

## Building community

Multilingual publishing will help democratize access to quality resources for learning and teaching the necessary digital skills to become contributors to open source projects and to have a workflow for performing computationally reproducible open science.

At rOpenSci, we understand review as a way of building community.
Developing the material for our review process in Spanish will allow rOpenSci to continue building the community in Spanish-speaking regions (such as Latin America), to increase the number of contributors, and to get feedback on how our tools and processes can be improved to better serve these community members.

In addition to learning how to be a developer, maintainer, reviewer, or editor, people can also contribute through translation.
This type of contribution is often a good first step and is recognized as valuable by the community.

We also expect that the project's documentation and tooling will be useful for extending this effort to other languages and for other communities and projects with translation efforts.
