## Language barrier

According to a [recent report](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/the-2021-linux-foundation-report-on-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-in-open-source) from The Linux Foundation, _language access_ is one of the _environmental barriers to equity in open source_. The report states that 

> The predominant language of open source is English—in code, content, and community interactions—and English proficiency is a metric by which performance and personality can be judged[^1]. 


By publishing multilingual resources we can lower these
barriers by _increasing access to knowledge_ and
_democratize access to quality resources_, thereby
_increasing the potential for individuals to contribute_ to software 
and open science projects.

## Language representation

The Spanish-speaking R community has been very active and growing in recent years, and has undertaken various translation activities for technical materials such as books, cheatsheets, guides, and datasets.

In 2017, several Latin American [R-Ladies](https://www.rladies.org/) began translating the R-Ladies' [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/rladies/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and their Rules and Guidelines into Spanish.

In 2018, the [R community in Latin America collectively translated](https://youtu.be/kuHjpdgkSxg) the [R for Data Science](https://es.r4ds.hadley.nz/) book into Spanish. This included the translation of all the data sets used in the book, which were compiled in the [datos](https://github.com/cienciadedatos/datos) package, making it an excellent tool for teaching.

The community continued with the translation of [Teaching Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/es/index.html) and contributed to the translations into Spanish of the [Posit Cheatsheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/?type=translations/#translation-12),
[The Carpentries](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)’ 
and [The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/es/) lessons.

Driven by this active and growing Spanish-speaking community, rOpenSci [successfully piloted](https://ropensci.org/blog/2021/07/27/censo2017/) our first [Spanish-language peer review](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/2019-06-28/), where the submission itself, as well as all reviews and editorial responses, were in Spanish.

All of this work and previous experience created the right conditions for us to start our multilingual publishing in Spanish!
Spanish is the second most-spoken native language in the world and is one of the most geographically widespread languages, being an official language in many countries[^2].

## Building community

Multilingual publishing will help democratize access to quality resources for learning and teaching the necessary digital skills to become contributors to open source projects and to have a workflow for performing computationally reproducible open science.

At rOpenSci, we understand review as a way of building community.
Developing the material for our review process in Spanish will allow rOpenSci to continue building the community in Spanish-speaking regions (such as Latin America), to increase the number of contributors, and to get feedback on how our tools and processes can be improved to better serve these community members.

In addition to learning how to be a developer, maintainer, reviewer, or editor, people can also contribute through translation.
This type of contribution is often a good first step and is recognized as valuable by the community.

We also expect that the project's documentation and tooling will be useful for extending this effort to other languages and for other communities and projects with translation efforts.
