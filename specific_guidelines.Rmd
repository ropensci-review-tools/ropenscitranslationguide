# Specific Guidelines

::: callout-note
If you want to read the guidelines for a specific language, place change the version of the Translation Guide to that language using the language list on the left.

## Technical terms and citations

1.  Maintain a list of terms that are translated and another list of terms that are not.
    We propose a initial list and we consult our community (Slack first, social networks when there is not agreement).

2.  For bibliographic references,
    the original title/name is left in English with the words in italics;
    a translation of the title in Spanish is added in parentheses.
    When a reference to a Wikipedia entry, a Carpentries lesson, or other online resource occurs,
    the Spanish version is added to the link if it exists.
    If one cannot be found, the reference is left in English.
    
## Code

Translate:

1. variables names;

2. constant names;

3. comments;

4. user function names and parameters names: if a code snippet creates a function as example, we can name it and their parameters in Spanish. 

> example:
    
    Original code:
    
       inside <- function(point, lower, higher) {
            if (point <= lower) {
                return false
            } else if (point >= higher) {
                return false
            } else {
                return true
            }
       }
        
    Translation to Spanish:

      adentro <- function(punto, mas_bajo, mas_alto) {
            if (punto <= mas_bajo) {
                return false
            } else if (punto >= mas_alto) {
                return false
            } else {
                return true
            }
       }
   
## Diagrams

1. Figure and diagrams are translated.
2. Screenshots are translated only if the IDE or UI exist in the language of the translation.
