# Specific Guidelines

::: callout-note
This chapter is different for each language. It contains the specific guidelines for translating the content under the agreements of the community.

To read the guidelines for a specific language, place change the version of the Translation Guide to that language using the language list on the left.
:::

This guidelines apply when translating content to English.

## Technical terms and citations

1.  Maintain a list of terms that are translated and another list of terms that are not.
    We propose a initial list and we consult our community (Slack first, social networks when there is not agreement).

2.  For bibliographic references,
    the original title/name is left in the original languaje, with the words in italics;
    a translation of the title in English is added in parentheses.
    When a reference to a Wikipedia entry, a Carpentries lesson, or other online resource occurs,
    the English version is added to the link if it exists.
    If one cannot be found, the reference is left in the original language.
    
## Code

Translate:

1. variables names;

2. constant names;

3. comments;

4. user function names and parameters names: if a code snippet creates a function as example, we can name it and their parameters in English. 

> example:
    
    Original code:
    
    adentro <- function(punto, mas_bajo, mas_alto) {
            if (punto <= mas_bajo) {
                return false
            } else if (punto >= mas_alto) {
                return false
            } else {
                return true
            }
       }  
        
    Translation to English:
    
     inside <- function(point, lower, higher) {
            if (point <= lower) {
                return false
            } else if (point >= higher) {
                return false
            } else {
                return true
            }
       }

      
   
## Diagrams

1. Figure and diagrams are translated.
2. Screenshots are translated only if the IDE or UI exist in English.

## Data

If there is a translated version of the data, for example with the variable names in English, that data is used. 

If there is not, the original data is used, mentioning what the variable names mean.

Finally, a project can be initiated to translate the data or to select data in English meaningful to the target audience that can replace the original data ([see project dados for an example of translation of data from English to Portuguese](https://cienciadedatos.github.io/dados/)).

# Glossary {#glosario-en}

This glossary is developed as part of the translations of the rOpenSci material. It supports the task of determining which technical terms are translated and which are not.  It is also the source that determines which words we prefer to use before the possibility of having more than one option.

As reference sources to generate our glossary and keep it up to date, the following can be used [Wikipedia](https://es.wikipedia.org/), [GLosario](https://glosario.carpentries.org/) and the bilingual dictionary of [Teaching Tech Together](https://yabellini.shinyapps.io/T3Glossary/)
